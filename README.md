### Welcome to my GitHub profile. :computer::wave:


I'm a data analyst based on Ontario, Canada. Check out some of my code on my [portfolio page](https://github.com/jzeyl/Portfolio). Here you can find repositories about acoustics and working with anatomy data, and lots of scripts dealing with data processing, analysis, and visualization.
