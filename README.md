### Welcome to my GitHub profile. :computer::wave:

 Iâ€™m interested in data analysis, data visualization, and web development :bar_chart::chart_with_upwards_trend:.  
 Check out some of my work on my [portfolio page](https://github.com/jzeyl/Portfolio). Here you can find repositories about acoustics and working with anatomy data :ear::sound:, and lots of scripts dealing with data processing, analysis, and visualization.
